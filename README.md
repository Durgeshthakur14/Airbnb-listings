# Airbnb-listings
This project uses SQL queries to analyze and visualize data from Airbnb listings. By comparing and contrasting various factors such as location, listing features, and user metrics, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors that influence Airbnb pricing and demand.
Some of the specific SQL queries in this project include:
#analyze reviews scored by guests who have used an Airbnb
#booking based on their popularity
#investigate listing host data
#correlation between listing prices and other factors
#top-performing hosts in terms of booking count 
#trends in listing prices over time, considering factors such as the location or the property type.
#number of nights booked or the availability of the listing
